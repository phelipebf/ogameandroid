**Q: Can my account get blocked for using this app? / Is this app legal?**

A: OGame (Gameforge) does not officially allow the use of this (or any other) app.
But the app does (mostly) simulate what you whould do with a browser, making it nearly impossible to detect.

**Q: Button X on Screen Y is disabled or not working. What am I doing wrong?**

A: Most likely it's not your fault. If a button is disabled (grayed-out) it's because the functionality is not implemented or released yet. If a button is clickable but does nothing it's because we forgot to disable or hide it on release ;).
